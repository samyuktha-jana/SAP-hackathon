  "chosen_upskillingplan": "## Upskilling Roadmap: CX AI Solutions Engineer\n\n**Weighted Gap Index:** 1.0\n\n**Goal:** Achieve proficiency in missing and underdeveloped skills to excel as a CX AI Solutions Engineer.\n\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (6-8 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Priority 1: Integration (Need Level 3, Weight 3.5)**\n\n* **Rationale:**  Strong integration skills are foundational for connecting AI solutions with existing systems.\n* **Courses:**\n    * CX103: Integration Fundamentals (focus on APIs and relevant protocols for CX systems)\n    * Optional:  API-specific course based on your company's tech stack (e.g., REST API course if relevant).\n* **Mini Project:** Develop a simple integration between a mock customer database and a communication platform (e.g., sending automated emails based on database triggers using Python and an API).\n* **Interdependencies:** This skill is crucial for Phase 2 SAP C4C and AI/ML projects.\n\n\n**Priority 2: SAP C4C (Need Level 3, Weight 3.5)**\n\n* **Rationale:** Mastering SAP C4C is essential for effective deployment and management of AI solutions within the customer experience ecosystem.\n* **Courses:**\n    * CX101: SAP C4C Fundamentals (covering core functionalities, administration, and configurations)\n    * Optional:  SAP C4C integration with other systems course if available.\n* **Mini Project:** Configure a simple workflow automation within SAP C4C (e.g., automating lead assignment based on specific criteria).\n* **Interdependencies:**  This skill will enhance the project in Phase 2 relating to AI/ML integration into the C4C system.\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills Development (8-12 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Priority 1: AI/ML (Need Level 3, Weight 0.7)**\n\n* **Rationale:**  Essential for developing and implementing intelligent CX solutions.\n* **Courses:**\n    * CX102: AI/ML for CX (focus on applications relevant to customer experience, such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling).  Ensure the course uses Python.\n    *  Optional:  Course specializing in a specific AI/ML technique relevant to your role (e.g., NLP or time series analysis).\n* **Mini Project:** Develop a simple machine learning model to predict customer churn using a publicly available dataset.  Integrate this into a basic prototype within the C4C system.\n* **Interdependencies:** This builds upon Python skills from Phase 1 and integrates with the SAP C4C knowledge gained earlier.\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Specialization (Ongoing, flexible hours)**\n\nThis phase focuses on continuous learning and specialization within chosen areas of AI/ML and  SAP C4C based on ongoing project needs and emerging technologies.  Consider focusing on specific areas like advanced analytics, deep learning for CX, or specialized SAP C4C modules relevant to your company.  This phase is less structured and will involve self-directed learning, attending webinars, and working on advanced projects.\n\n**Timeline Summary:**\n\n* **Phase 1:** 6-8 weeks\n* **Phase 2:** 8-12 weeks\n* **Phase 3:** Ongoing\n\n**Interdependencies Summary:**\n\n* Phase 1 Integration skills are critical for both Phase 2 SAP C4C and AI/ML projects.\n* Phase 1 SAP C4C knowledge enhances the Phase 2 AI/ML integration project.\n* Phase 2 AI/ML skills build upon Python and Phase 1 Integration and C4C skills.\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Successful completion of mini-projects:**  Each mini-project should have clearly defined deliverables and acceptance criteria.\n2. **Achievement of target scores on course assessments:** This demonstrates competency in the core concepts of each course.\n3. **Completion of a capstone project:** A final integrated project showcasing the combined skills learned across all phases (e.g., building and deploying an AI-powered customer service chatbot integrated with SAP C4C).  This should be a larger scale project that can be presented to management demonstrating practical application of gained skills.\n",
