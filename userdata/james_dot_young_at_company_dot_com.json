  "chosen_upskillingplan": "## Upskilling Roadmap: CX AI Solutions Engineer\n\n**Weighted Gap Index:** 0.92\n\nThis roadmap prioritizes addressing the critical skills gaps to rapidly improve performance and meet the role's requirements.  It incorporates manager feedback to ensure immediate impact.\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Address immediate performance concerns highlighted by the manager and build a foundation in critical skills.\n\n* **(Manager priority) Integration (SQL & API):** Improve SQL and API design skills to directly address the manager's feedback on integration defects.\n    * **Rationale:**  Focus on practical application to immediately improve integration delivery quality.\n    * **Courses:** CX103 (Integration Fundamentals),  Online SQL tutorials (Codecademy, Khan Academy) \u2013 choose one based on your preferred learning style.\n    * **Mini Project:** Design and implement a REST API to integrate two simple systems (e.g., a database and a mock CRM).  Focus on clean code, error handling, and robust API design.\n\n* **Python Enhancement (Foundation):** Strengthen existing Python skills to support future AI/ML learning.\n    * **Rationale:** Building a solid Python base is crucial for effective AI/ML implementation.\n    * **Courses:** CX104 (Python for Data Science), LeetCode Python practice sets (focus on data structures and algorithms).\n    * **Mini Project:** Develop a simple Python script to automate a repetitive task, like data cleaning or analysis from a CSV file.\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Develop proficiency in core skills required for the role.\n\n* **AI/ML Fundamentals:** Gain foundational knowledge in AI/ML concepts and techniques.\n    * **Rationale:**  Essential for understanding and implementing AI solutions within the CX domain.\n    * **Courses:** CX102 (AI/ML for CX),  Online AI/ML courses (Coursera, edX) \u2013 choose one that aligns with your learning preference and the CX context.\n    * **Mini Project:** Build a simple machine learning model to predict customer churn using a publicly available dataset (e.g., Kaggle).\n\n* **SAP C4C Introduction:** Get familiar with the core functionalities and data structures of SAP C4C.\n    * **Rationale:** Necessary for effective implementation and integration of AI/ML solutions within the SAP C4C environment.\n    * **Courses:** CX101 (SAP C4C Fundamentals).\n    * **Mini Project:** Explore the SAP C4C system (access may be required through your employer) and build a basic report using its reporting tools.\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Application (6 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Integrate learned skills to build complex solutions and develop advanced expertise.\n\n* **Advanced Integration with AI/ML & SAP C4C:** Integrate AI/ML models with SAP C4C via APIs.\n    * **Rationale:** This combines all learned skills to solve real-world problems.\n    * **Courses:**  Advanced API integration courses (specific to SAP C4C and chosen AI/ML frameworks).  Consider online tutorials and documentation relevant to your chosen AI/ML platform and integration method.\n    * **Mini Project:** Build a more sophisticated AI-powered feature within SAP C4C (e.g., a predictive customer service routing system or a chatbot).\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**\n\n* Phase 2 (AI/ML) and Phase 2 (SAP C4C) are relatively independent but both are prerequisites for Phase 3.\n* Python (Phase 1) directly supports Phase 2 (AI/ML) and Phase 3.\n* Strong integration skills (Phase 1) are critical throughout all phases.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* Phase 1: 4 weeks\n* Phase 2: 8 weeks\n* Phase 3: 6 weeks\n\n**Total Estimated Time:** 18 weeks\n\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Successful Completion of Mini-Projects:**  Track completion and quality of mini-projects in each phase.\n2. **Integration Defect Rate:** Monitor the number of defects in integration work after Phase 1. Aim for a significant reduction.\n3. **AI/ML Model Accuracy:**  Measure the accuracy of the AI/ML models developed in Phase 2 and 3, using appropriate metrics (e.g., AUC, precision, recall).\n\n\nThis roadmap provides a structured approach to upskilling.  Regular check-ins and adjustments based on progress and learning style are recommended. Remember to leverage internal resources (like DS101) where appropriate.\n",
