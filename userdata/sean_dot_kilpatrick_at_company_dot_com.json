  "chosen_upskillingplan": "## Upskilling Roadmap: CX AI Solutions Engineer\n\n**Weighted Gap Index:** 0.92\n\nThis roadmap prioritizes addressing the critical skill gaps to rapidly improve performance and meet the manager's expectations, focusing on quick wins before tackling more advanced concepts.\n\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Address immediate manager feedback and build foundational skills for integration.\n\n* **(Manager priority) Integration Fundamentals:**  Improve SQL and API design skills to directly address the manager's concerns about integration defects.\n    * **Courses:** CX103 (Integration),  relevant online SQL tutorials (e.g., Codecademy, Khan Academy).\n    * **Mini-project:** Design and implement a simple REST API to integrate two dummy data sources (e.g., a database and a CSV file) using SQL queries and API endpoints.  Focus on error handling and robust design.\n\n* **Python Enhancement (Addressing Underdeveloped Skill):** Strengthen existing Python knowledge to support integration tasks and future AI/ML work.\n    * **Courses:** CX104 (Python), LeetCode practice sets (focus on data structures & algorithms relevant to API interactions).\n    * **Mini-project:**  Write Python scripts to automate simple database interactions (e.g., data extraction, transformation, loading - ETL) using the database from the previous mini-project.\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:**  Acquire core skills in SAP C4C and AI/ML to build a solid foundation for the role.\n\n* **SAP C4C:** Gain a fundamental understanding of SAP C4C to leverage its functionalities in CX solutions.\n    * **Courses:** CX101 (SAP C4C) , official SAP C4C tutorials.\n    * **Mini-project:** Build a simple customer interaction scenario within a sandbox SAP C4C environment.  Focus on basic functionalities like lead management and opportunity creation.\n\n* **AI/ML Fundamentals:** Develop a working knowledge of fundamental AI/ML concepts and techniques relevant to CX.\n    * **Courses:** CX102 (AI/ML),  introductory online courses (e.g., Coursera's Machine Learning by Andrew Ng - select relevant modules).\n    * **Mini-project:** Build a simple predictive model (e.g., customer churn prediction) using a publicly available dataset and a suitable library (e.g., scikit-learn).\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Applications (6 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Integrate learned skills to build advanced CX AI solutions.\n\n* **Advanced Integration with AI/ML:** Combine knowledge of SAP C4C, AI/ML, and integration to build more complex solutions.\n    * **Courses:** Advanced integration tutorials specific to SAP C4C and chosen AI/ML libraries.\n    * **Mini-project:** Integrate the predictive model from Phase 2 with the SAP C4C environment.  For example, use the churn prediction model to identify at-risk customers and trigger automated actions within SAP C4C.\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**\n\n* Phase 1's Python enhancement directly supports Phase 1's integration work and lays the foundation for Phase 2's AI/ML learning (many AI/ML libraries utilize Python).\n* Phase 2's SAP C4C knowledge and Phase 2's AI/ML skills are crucial for the advanced integration project in Phase 3.\n\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* Phase 1: 4 weeks\n* Phase 2: 8 weeks\n* Phase 3: 6 weeks\n\n**Total estimated time:** 18 weeks (approximately 4 months)\n\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Successful Completion of Mini-Projects:**  All mini-projects completed with documented code and results.\n2. **Improved Integration Performance:** Reduction in integration defects as measured by the number of bugs reported in subsequent projects or deployments.\n3. **AI/ML Model Accuracy:**  Accuracy score (e.g., AUC, precision, recall) of the predictive model built in Phase 2 and integrated in Phase 3.\n\n\n**Note:** This roadmap is a suggestion and can be adjusted based on individual learning pace and available resources.  Regular check-ins with the manager to review progress and adapt the plan are recommended.  Prioritizing specific modules within larger courses to focus on directly relevant content will improve efficiency.\n",
