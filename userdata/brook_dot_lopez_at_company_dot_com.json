  "chosen_upskillingplan": "## Upskilling Roadmap: CX AI Solutions Engineer\n\n**Weighted Gap Index:** 0.92\n\n**Overall Goal:** Achieve proficiency in SAP C4C, AI/ML, and Integration, while strengthening Python skills to meet the requirements of a CX AI Solutions Engineer role.  Address immediate manager concerns regarding integration quality.\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 weeks, 20-24 hours)**\n\n**Focus:** Addressing immediate manager feedback and building foundational skills for smoother integration.\n\n* **(Manager priority) Integration Fundamentals:**  Improve SQL and API design skills to directly address manager concerns.\n    * **Rationale:** Immediate improvement in integration quality is crucial to address negative manager feedback.\n    * **Course:** CX103 (Integration) \u2013 focus on SQL and API design sections.\n    * **Mini-Project:** Design and implement a simple REST API to integrate two dummy data sources (e.g., using Python and a lightweight database like SQLite).  Focus on clean, documented code and robust error handling.\n\n\n* **(Manager priority) Python for Integration:** Strengthen Python skills relevant to integration tasks.\n    * **Rationale:**  Python is essential for efficient integration scripting and automation.\n    * **Course:**  CX104 (Python) \u2013 Modules relevant to API interaction and data manipulation.\n    * **Mini-Project:**  Write a Python script to consume the REST API created in the previous mini-project, process data, and output results in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON).\n\n\n* **Python Fundamentals (if time allows):** Solidify basic Python skills.\n    * **Rationale:** A strong foundation in Python is crucial for all subsequent learning.\n    * **Course:**  Coursera: Python for Everybody (focus on relevant sections).\n    * **Mini-Project:**  Solve a selection of LeetCode easy/medium problems focusing on data structures and algorithms.\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 weeks, 40-48 hours)**\n\n**Focus:** Mastering core technologies crucial for the role.\n\n* **SAP C4C:** Learn the fundamentals of SAP C4C.\n    * **Rationale:** SAP C4C is a critical component of the CX ecosystem.\n    * **Course:** CX101 (SAP C4C)\n    * **Mini-Project:**  Create a simple custom report or extension within a sandbox SAP C4C environment.\n\n\n* **AI/ML Foundations:** Gain foundational knowledge of AI and Machine Learning.\n    * **Rationale:**  AI/ML is increasingly important for CX solutions.\n    * **Course:** CX102 (AI/ML) \u2013 focus on supervised learning and model deployment.\n    * **Mini-Project:** Develop a simple predictive model (e.g., customer churn prediction) using a readily available dataset and a suitable library (e.g., scikit-learn).\n\n\n* **Advanced Integration Techniques:** Explore advanced integration patterns and best practices.\n    * **Rationale:**  Mastering integration is critical for connecting various systems.\n    * **Course:**  CX103 (Integration) \u2013 Advanced topics like message queuing, API gateways, and ETL processes.\n    * **Mini-Project:** Integrate a simple AI model (from Phase 2) into the existing REST API from Phase 1 to enhance its functionality.\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Application (8 weeks, 40-48 hours)**\n\n**Focus:** Applying learned skills to complex scenarios and advanced techniques.\n\n* **SAP C4C Advanced Configurations:** Explore advanced configurations and customizations in SAP C4C.\n    * **Rationale:**  Become proficient in handling real-world scenarios.\n    * **Course:**  (Consider additional, specialized SAP C4C courses based on project needs).\n    * **Mini-Project:** Develop a more complex C4C custom solution (e.g., integration with another system, advanced reporting).\n\n\n* **Advanced AI/ML Techniques:** Explore advanced AI/ML techniques relevant to CX.\n    * **Rationale:** Develop expertise in sophisticated AI applications.\n    * **Course:** (Consider specialized AI/ML courses focusing on NLP, computer vision, or reinforcement learning based on specific project requirements).\n    * **Mini-Project:** Develop a more complex AI model involving multiple datasets and advanced techniques.\n\n\n* **Cloud-based Integration Architectures:** Explore cloud-native integration platforms and architectures (e.g., serverless functions).\n    * **Rationale:**  Prepare for modern, scalable integration solutions.\n    * **Course:** (Explore cloud provider-specific integration services, e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions).\n    * **Mini-Project:** Migrate the existing integration solution to a cloud-based architecture.\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**  Phase 1 Python skills are crucial for Phase 2 Integration and Phase 2 AI/ML projects often leverage Python. Successful completion of Phase 2 is foundational for Phase 3.\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Successful completion of mini-projects:**  Each mini-project should have defined success criteria (e.g., functionality, code quality, performance).\n2. **Manager feedback on integration improvements:**  Track improvements in integration quality based on manager feedback.\n3. **Completion of courses and quizzes with a minimum passing score (e.g., 80%).**  This demonstrates acquisition of knowledge.\n",
