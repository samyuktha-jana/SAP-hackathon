  "chosen_upskillingplan": "## Upskilling Roadmap: CX AI Solutions Engineer\n\n**Weighted Gap Index:** 0.92\n\nThis roadmap prioritizes addressing critical skill gaps to rapidly improve performance and meet the needs of the role.  It leverages the manager's feedback to ensure immediate impact.\n\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Focus:** Addressing immediate manager concerns and building foundational skills for future learning.\n\n* **(Manager priority) Integration Improvements:**  Improve SQL and API design skills to directly address inconsistent delivery and defects.\n    * **Rationale:**  Immediate improvement in core job function.\n    * **Courses:** CX103 (Integration),  relevant online tutorials focusing on REST APIs and SQL best practices (e.g., freeCodeCamp, Udemy).\n    * **Mini Project:** Design and implement a simple REST API to integrate two hypothetical customer service systems (e.g., using Python and a mock database).  Document the API using OpenAPI specification.\n\n* **(Manager priority) Python Enhancement:** Strengthen Python skills to facilitate integration and future AI/ML projects.\n    * **Rationale:** Enables more efficient and robust integration work and lays the groundwork for AI/ML.\n    * **Courses:** CX104 (Python), LeetCode practice sets (focus on data structures and algorithms).\n    * **Mini Project:**  Develop a small script to automate a repetitive task related to data processing or API interaction in your current workflow.\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Focus:** Building core capabilities in AI/ML and SAP C4C.\n\n\n* **AI/ML Fundamentals:** Gain a foundational understanding of AI/ML concepts and techniques.\n    * **Rationale:** Essential for leveraging AI/ML in CX solutions.\n    * **Courses:** CX102 (AI/ML), relevant online courses on machine learning algorithms (e.g., Coursera, edX).\n    * **Mini Project:** Build a simple machine learning model (e.g., using scikit-learn) to predict customer churn based on a sample dataset.\n\n\n* **SAP C4C Introduction:** Familiarize yourself with the core functionalities and architecture of SAP C4C.\n    * **Rationale:** Enables effective work within the SAP ecosystem.\n    * **Courses:** CX101 (SAP C4C),  SAP Learning Hub materials on C4C.\n    * **Mini Project:**  Explore the different modules within a trial SAP C4C system.  Document key features and their interrelationships.\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Applications (6 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Focus:** Integrating learned skills to build more complex solutions.  This phase requires strong foundation from Phases 1 & 2.\n\n* **AI-powered CX Solution:** Integrate AI/ML models with SAP C4C to enhance customer service operations.\n    * **Rationale:** Develop the ability to build complete, intelligent CX solutions.\n    * **Courses:** Advanced AI/ML courses specialized in natural language processing or customer service applications.\n    * **Mini Project:** Develop a prototype of a chatbot for SAP C4C using a pre-trained NLP model.\n\n\n* **Advanced Integration Techniques:** Explore advanced integration patterns and technologies beyond REST APIs.\n    * **Rationale:** Expand skillset to handle more complex integration scenarios.\n    * **Courses:** Advanced integration courses covering message queues (e.g., Kafka), event-driven architectures.\n    * **Mini Project:** Design and implement an integration solution using a message queue to handle asynchronous communication between different systems.\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**\n\n* Phase 1 (Python) is crucial for Phase 2 (AI/ML) and Phase 3 (integration projects).\n* Phase 2 (SAP C4C and AI/ML) are fundamental for Phase 3's advanced applications.\n\n**Timeline:**  Total estimated time: 18 weeks (flexible based on individual learning pace).\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Successful completion of mini-projects:** Demonstrates practical application of learned skills.\n2. **Improved integration performance:** Measured by a reduction in defects and improved delivery consistency (trackable via manager feedback).\n3. **Completion of specified courses and achieving target scores/grades:** Quantifiable evidence of skill acquisition.\n\n\nThis roadmap provides a structured approach to upskilling. Remember to adjust the timeline and project scope based on your individual learning speed and capacity.  Regular check-ins with your manager are recommended to ensure alignment and address any roadblocks encountered.\n",
