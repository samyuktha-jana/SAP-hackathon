  "chosen_upskillingplan": "## Upskilling Roadmap: Integration & API Engineer\n\n**Weighted Gap Index:** 0.931\n\nThis roadmap prioritizes bridging the significant skills gap to achieve proficiency as an Integration & API Engineer.  Given the high Weighted Gap Index, a focused and structured approach is crucial.\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Address immediate needs and demonstrate quick progress, focusing on foundational APIs and addressing manager feedback.\n\n* **(Manager priority) Power BI Enhancement:**  Improve Power BI dashboard capabilities.\n    * **Rationale:** Directly addresses manager feedback regarding dashboard depth and advanced features.\n    * **Course/Resource:**  Power BI online learning path (Microsoft Learn), focusing on DAX, advanced visualizations, and interactive reports.\n    * **Mini-project:** Create an interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing sample integration data (e.g., REST API call results).  This will showcase improved data visualization skills.\n\n* **REST APIs (Need Level 3):** Build a foundational understanding of REST principles.\n    * **Rationale:** REST is fundamental for API interaction and is a prerequisite for more advanced technologies like SAP CPI.\n    * **Course:** API102\n    * **Mini-project:**  Build a simple REST API client in Python to fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) and display it.\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Master core integration technologies and solidify Python skills.  Interdependencies are explicitly addressed here.\n\n* **SAP CPI (Need Level 4):** Gain proficiency in SAP CPI for integration scenarios.\n    * **Rationale:** This is the highest weighted missing skill, critical for many integration roles.\n    * **Course:** API101\n    * **Mini-project:** Develop a simple integration flow in SAP CPI using an existing REST API (from Phase 1) to transfer data between two systems (e.g., from a database to a cloud storage).\n\n* **Python (Need Level 2):** Improve Python proficiency to support API development and scripting.\n    * **Rationale:**  Python is needed for various automation and scripting tasks related to API interaction and data processing.\n    * **Courses:** API104, Coursera: Python for Everybody (choose one based on learning style)\n    * **Mini-project:** Write a Python script to automate a repetitive task related to API interaction, such as data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).\n\n\n* **OData (Need Level 3):** Understand OData principles and its application in API interactions.\n    * **Rationale:** OData is a common standard for accessing and manipulating data via APIs.\n    * **Course:** API103\n    * **Mini-project:** Create a simple OData client in Python to interact with an OData service and retrieve/update data.\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Skills (6 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:**  Enhance expertise, explore advanced techniques and broaden the skillset.\n\n* **Advanced SAP CPI:** Explore advanced features of SAP CPI like error handling, monitoring, and security.\n    * **Rationale:**  Mastering advanced features is essential for robust and secure integration solutions.\n    * **Course:**  SAP CPI advanced training (check for relevant SAP courses)\n    * **Mini-project:**  Develop a more complex integration flow in SAP CPI involving multiple systems, error handling, and security considerations.\n\n* **API Security Best Practices:** Learn about API security vulnerabilities and best practices for securing APIs.\n    * **Rationale:**  API security is paramount to protect data and prevent breaches.\n    * **Course:**  Online courses on API security (OWASP API Security Top 10), secure coding practices.\n    * **Mini-project:**  Perform a security assessment on a simple API you've developed (e.g., from Phase 2) and implement security improvements.\n\n* **Advanced Python for APIs:** Explore advanced Python libraries for API development, such as Flask or Django (for backend) and testing frameworks.\n    * **Rationale:**  Leverage Python for building more complex APIs and testing.\n    * **Course:**  Online courses on Flask/Django or testing frameworks (e.g., pytest)\n    * **Mini-project:**  Develop a simple REST API using Flask or Django, including appropriate testing.\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**  Phase 1 REST API knowledge is crucial for Phase 2 SAP CPI and Phase 2 Python enhances all subsequent phases.  Strong Python skills from Phase 2 are essential for the advanced API projects in Phase 3.\n\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Power BI Dashboard Score:** Manager assessment of improved dashboard functionality (e.g., using a rubric).\n2. **Successful API Integrations:** Number of successfully completed integration mini-projects (e.g., 3 successful integrations across all phases).\n3. **Code quality & test coverage:**  Percentage of code covered by automated tests in the mini-projects (aim for at least 80% in Phase 3).\n\n\nThis roadmap is a suggestion and can be adapted based on individual learning pace and available resources.  Regular review and adjustment are recommended.\n",
