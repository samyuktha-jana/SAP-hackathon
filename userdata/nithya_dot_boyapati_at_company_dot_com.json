  "chosen_upskillingplan": "## Upskilling Roadmap: CX AI Solutions Engineer\n\n**Weighted Gap Index:** 0.92\n\nThis roadmap prioritizes addressing the significant skills gap to rapidly improve your capabilities as a CX AI Solutions Engineer.  It incorporates manager feedback to ensure immediate impact.\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 Weeks)**\n\n* **Focus:** Address immediate manager feedback and build foundational skills in Python.  This phase aims for rapid demonstrable improvements.\n\n* **(Manager priority) Power BI Advanced Features:**  Rationale: Directly addresses manager feedback regarding dashboard depth.\n    * **Course:**  DataCamp's \"Power BI for Business Professionals\" (focus on advanced features like DAX and custom visuals).\n    * **Mini-project:** Recreate existing dashboards, incorporating advanced features and improved visualizations based on identified shortcomings.  Measure impact by comparing previous and updated dashboard performance metrics (e.g., user engagement, data clarity).\n\n* **Python Enhancement:** Rationale: Strengthen existing Python skills to support future AI/ML learning.\n    * **Course:** Coursera's \"Python for Everybody\" (focus on data manipulation and visualization libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib).\n    * **Mini-project:**  Create a simple data analysis script using a public dataset (e.g., from Kaggle), visualizing key insights.\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 Weeks)**\n\n* **Focus:** Develop essential skills in Integration and AI/ML, laying the groundwork for advanced SAP C4C implementation.\n\n* **Integration:** Rationale:  Essential for connecting different systems within a CX solution.\n    * **Course:** CX103 (Integration) and relevant tutorials on specific integration technologies used in your environment (e.g., APIs, middleware).\n    * **Mini-project:** Develop a simple integration between two systems (e.g., connecting a database to a web application using an API).\n\n* **AI/ML Fundamentals:** Rationale: Foundational knowledge in AI/ML is crucial for effective CX solutions.\n    * **Course:** CX102 (AI/ML).  Focus on supervised and unsupervised learning techniques relevant to customer data analysis.\n    * **Mini-project:** Build a simple predictive model (e.g., customer churn prediction) using a relevant dataset and Python libraries (Scikit-learn).\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Specialization (12 Weeks)**\n\n* **Focus:** Master SAP C4C and integrate learned skills to build sophisticated CX AI solutions.\n\n* **SAP C4C Mastery:** Rationale:  Deep understanding of SAP C4C is essential for effective implementation and optimization of AI solutions.\n    * **Course:** CX101 (SAP C4C). Focus on advanced configuration and customization options.\n    * **Mini-project:** Develop a custom solution within SAP C4C that leverages AI/ML for improved customer service or personalization (e.g., intelligent chatbots, personalized recommendations).  This project will integrate knowledge gained in all previous phases.\n\n**Interdependencies:**\n\n* Phase 2 (Integration & AI/ML) build upon Phase 1 (Python).\n* Phase 3 (SAP C4C) relies on the completion of Phase 2 skills.\n\n**Timeline (Assuming 5-6 hours/week):**\n\n* Phase 1: 4 weeks\n* Phase 2: 8 weeks\n* Phase 3: 12 weeks\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Power BI Dashboard Improvements:**  Measure the increase in user engagement (e.g., views, interactions) and improved data clarity (e.g., reduced support tickets regarding dashboard interpretation) post-implementation of advanced features.\n2. **Successful Integration Implementation:**  Track the successful execution of the integration mini-project by measuring key performance indicators (KPIs) (e.g., data transfer speed, error rate).\n3. **AI/ML Model Accuracy:** Evaluate the performance of the predictive model using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and demonstrate improvement over baseline.\n\n\nThis roadmap provides a structured approach to achieving your upskilling goals, addressing manager feedback, and building a strong foundation in CX AI Solutions Engineering. Remember to adapt the courses and mini-projects to your specific organizational context and available resources.\n",
