REST API knowledge is crucial before tackling SAP CPI and OData.  Improved Python skills are essential for efficient API interaction and scripting throughout the process.\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Completion of Courses and Certifications:** Track the completion of each course with certificates or assessments.\n2. **Successful Mini-Project Deployments:** Document and showcase the successful completion of each mini-project.\n3. **API Integration Success Rate:** Measure the success rate of integrations (e.g., successful data transfer, error handling) in mini-projects and, ultimately, a larger capstone project.  This metric should demonstrate functional proficiency.\n\n\n**Note:** This roadmap is a suggestion and can be adjusted based on individual learning pace and specific job requirements.  Continuous practice and real-world project experience are vital for skill retention and improvement.  Consider a capstone project at the end to synthesize all learned skills.\n",
