We'll focus on building a solid foundation before delving into advanced topics.\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 Weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Gain foundational understanding of Python and basic integration concepts to build confidence and momentum.\n\n| Skill             | Rationale                                                                 | Course(s)                                    | Mini Project                                           | Interdependencies |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Python (Level 2)** | Rapidly acquire basic scripting and data manipulation skills for future AI/ML work. | Coursera: Python for Everybody                    | Simple data analysis script (e.g., analyzing a CSV file)| None               |\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 Weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Develop proficiency in core technologies essential for the CX AI Solutions Engineer role.\n\n| Skill             | Rationale                                                                              | Course(s)                                  | Mini Project                                                                     | Interdependencies |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Integration (Level 3)** | Understand various integration patterns and techniques relevant to CRM systems and AI applications. | CX103                                         | Integrate a simple data source (e.g., CSV) with a dummy CRM using Python and APIs.      | Python             |\n| **AI/ML (Level 3)**      | Gain practical skills in applying AI/ML techniques to customer experience problems.     | CX102                                         | Build a simple machine learning model for customer churn prediction using a public dataset. | Python             |\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Specialization (12 Weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Master SAP C4C and integrate AI/ML models within the platform.\n\n| Skill             | Rationale                                                                            | Course(s)                                    | Mini Project                                                                                 | Interdependencies |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **SAP C4C (Level 3)** | Gain deep understanding of SAP C4C functionality and its integration capabilities.          | CX101                                         | Develop a custom SAP C4C extension integrating the AI/ML model from Phase 2.                  | AI/ML, Integration |\n\n\n**Interdependencies Summary:**  Python is a prerequisite for both Integration and AI/ML.  Successful completion of AI/ML and Integration is crucial before tackling the advanced SAP C4C integration project in Phase 3.\n\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* **Phase 1:** 4 weeks\n* **Phase 2:** 8 weeks\n* **Phase 3:** 12 weeks\n\n**Total estimated time:** 24 weeks (approximately 6 months)\n\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Project Completion Rate:** Percentage of mini-projects completed within each phase.  Target: 100%.\n2. **Skill Proficiency Scores:** Self-assessment scores (e.g., using a 1-5 scale) on each skill after completing relevant courses and projects. Target: Level 3 proficiency for all skills.\n3. **Integration Success Rate:** Percentage of successful API calls and data integrations in the mini-projects. Target: 95% success rate.\n\n\n**Note:** This roadmap is a suggestion.  Adjust the timeline and course selection based on your learning pace and resource availability. Consider supplementing with additional resources as needed.  Regular review and adaptation of this plan is essential to ensure progress.\n",
