  "chosen_upskillingplan": "## Upskilling Roadmap: CX AI Solutions Engineer\n\n**Weighted Gap Index:** 0.787\n\n**Overall Goal:** Achieve proficiency in AI/ML, Integration, Python, and SAP C4C to meet role requirements.\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 Weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**(Manager priority) Focus: Python & SQL polishing (Addressing Manager Feedback)**\n\n* **Skill:** Python (Level 2)\n    * **Rationale:**  Strengthening Python is crucial for AI/ML and integration tasks, directly addressing manager feedback.\n    * **Courses:** CX104 (priority), supplemented by Coursera: Python for Everybody (for broader foundational knowledge).\n    * **Mini-Project:**  Build a simple script to automate a repetitive task related to your current work (e.g., data extraction, report generation).  This directly applies learned skills to your existing workflow.\n\n**(Manager priority) Focus: SQL polishing (Addressing Manager Feedback)**\n\n* **Skill:** SQL (Implicit from Manager Feedback)\n    * **Rationale:** Improving SQL skills is essential for data manipulation and analysis, a key aspect of this role.\n    * **Courses:**  Identify a relevant online SQL course (e.g., Codecademy, Khan Academy) or leverage internal resources.\n    * **Mini-Project:**  Create SQL queries to analyze a dataset relevant to your work, focusing on complex joins, aggregations, and subqueries.\n\n\n* **Skill:** SAP C4C (Level 3)\n    * **Rationale:**  Addressing the underdeveloped skill to quickly improve operational efficiency within the existing system.\n    * **Courses:** CX101.\n    * **Mini-Project:** Identify a specific process within SAP C4C that can be streamlined or automated using existing functionalities.\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 Weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n* **Skill:** AI/ML (Level 3)\n    * **Rationale:** This is a critical skill for building AI-powered CX solutions.\n    * **Courses:** CX102.\n    * **Mini-Project:** Develop a simple machine learning model for a customer service task (e.g., sentiment analysis of customer feedback).  This utilizes Python skills developed in Phase 1.\n\n* **Skill:** Integration (Level 3)\n    * **Rationale:**  Essential for connecting different systems and data sources within the CX ecosystem.\n    * **Courses:** CX103.\n    * **Mini-Project:** Build a simple integration between two systems (e.g., using APIs) to transfer data relevant to your work. This builds upon the Python and potentially SQL skills from Phase 1.\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Applications (6 Weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n* **Skill:** Advanced AI/ML and Integration (Level 3+)\n    * **Rationale:**  Develop expertise in building complex and robust AI-powered solutions within a larger system context.\n    * **Courses:** Consider specialized courses or workshops focused on specific AI/ML techniques relevant to CX, such as advanced NLP or recommendation systems.  Explore further integration techniques like message queues and event-driven architectures.\n    * **Mini-Project:**  Develop a more advanced AI-powered solution, integrating multiple data sources and utilizing advanced AI techniques. This should be a substantial project showcasing your skills.\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**\n\n* Python is a prerequisite for AI/ML and Integration.\n* SQL knowledge is beneficial for data preprocessing in AI/ML projects.\n* Solid understanding of SAP C4C is beneficial for implementing AI/ML solutions within the existing system.\n\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* **Phase 1:** 4 weeks\n* **Phase 2:** 8 weeks\n* **Phase 3:** 6 weeks\n\n**Total Estimated Time:** 18 weeks (assuming 5-6 hours per week)\n\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Completion of specified courses and mini-projects:** Track completion of each course and mini-project in the roadmap.\n2. **Successful integration of learned skills into work tasks:** Document instances where the learned skills have been directly applied to improve efficiency or solve problems at work.\n3. **Manager feedback on improved performance:** Regularly solicit feedback from your manager on the practical application of learned skills and overall performance improvement.\n",
