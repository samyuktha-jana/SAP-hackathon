  "chosen_upskillingplan": "Overview\n\nOf course. Here is a prioritized learning roadmap designed for your role as a CX AI Solutions Engineer.\n\n### **Personalized Learning Roadmap: CX AI Solutions Engineer**\n\nThis roadmap is structured to address immediate manager feedback first, then build core competencies, and finally develop advanced, role-specific skills.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Quick Wins & Foundational Skills (4 Weeks)**\n\n*This phase focuses on addressing direct manager feedback and strengthening the foundational Python skills necessary for all subsequent learning.*\n\n*   **(Manager priority)** **Targeted Skill:** SQL\n    *   **Rationale:** Directly addresses your manager's feedback to polish your SQL, a critical skill for data analysis and validation in any solutions role.\n    *   **Suggested Courses:** LeetCode (SQL 50 Study Plan), Khan Academy's \"Intro to SQL\".\n    *   **Mini Practice Project:** Write 5 complex queries against a sample customer database. Your queries should use `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and a window function (`e.g., ROW_NUMBER()`) to identify the top 3 support agents with the fastest average ticket resolution time for the last quarter.\n\n*   **(Manager priority)** **Targeted Skill:** Python (Progressing from L1 to L1.5)\n    *   **Rationale:** Builds on the positive momentum your manager highlighted and is a foundational prerequisite for future AI/ML and integration tasks.\n    *   **Suggested Courses:** Coursera: \"Python for Everybody\" (focus on weeks 5-7 covering data structures and file access).\n    *   **Mini Practice Project:** Write a Python script that reads a CSV file of customer support tickets, identifies all tickets containing the word \"urgent,\" and writes them to a new \"priority_tickets.csv\" file.\n\n*   **(MentorMatch Takeaway)** **Targeted Skill:** Python (Progressing from L1.5 to L2)\n    *   **Rationale:** This formalizes your learning from basic scripting to a level required for data manipulation, directly progressing you from Level 1 to 2.\n    *   **Suggested Courses:** Internal: DS101; \"Introduction to Pandas\" on Kaggle Learn.\n    *   **Mini Practice Project:** Using the Pandas library in Python, ingest the same customer ticket CSV. Calculate and print the average resolution time per support category and identify the agent who has handled the most tickets.\n\n### **Phase 2: Core Competencies (6 Weeks)**\n\n*With foundations in place, this phase tackles the core missing skills for a solutions engineer: understanding integrations and the fundamentals of AI.*\n\n*   **Targeted Skill:** Integration (Building towards L3)\n    *   **Rationale:** As a solutions engineer, understanding how systems like SAP C4C connect to other platforms via APIs is a core job requirement.\n    *   **Suggested Courses:** \"API and Web Service Introduction\" on Udemy; SAP Learning Hub: \"Introduction to SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)\".\n    *   **Mini Practice Project:** Use Python's `requests` library to call a public REST API (like the JSONPlaceholder fake API). Your script should fetch user data, parse the JSON response, and print a formatted list of user names and email addresses.\n\n*   **Targeted Skill:** AI/ML (Building towards L3)\n    *   **Rationale:** This introduces the core concepts and terminology needed to design and discuss AI-driven CX solutions effectively with clients and internal teams.\n    *   **Suggested Courses:** Coursera: \"AI For Everyone\" by Andrew Ng; \"Elements of AI\" by the University of Helsinki.\n    *   **Mini Practice Project:** Research and write a one-page brief explaining how a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes) could be applied to inbound customer emails to automatically route them to the correct department (Sales, Support, Billing) based on their content.\n\n### **Phase 3: Advanced & Specialization (8 Weeks)**\n\n*This phase focuses on the highest-impact, most specialized skills for your role, applying the knowledge gained in the previous phases.*\n\n*   **Targeted Skill:** SAP C4C (Building towards L3)\n    *   **Rationale:** This is the highest-weighted missing skill and directly applies your integration and CX knowledge to a primary tool in the SAP ecosystem.\n    *   **Suggested Courses:** Official SAP Learning Hub courses for SAP Cloud for Customer (e.g., C4C10, C4C50); review SAP C4C's OData API documentation.\n    *   **Mini Practice Project:** In a development or sandbox environment, use a tool like Postman to interact with the C4C OData API. Your goal is to successfully create a new customer account and then create a new service ticket associated with that account via two separate API calls.\n\n*   **Targeted Skill:** Applied AI/ML with Python\n    *   **Rationale:** This advances your skill set from theoretical AI/ML knowledge to practical application using the Python data manipulation skills you've developed.\n    *   **Suggested Courses:** \"Applied Machine Learning in Python\" on Coursera (University of Michigan); Fast.ai: \"Practical Deep Learning for Coders\".\n    *   **Mini Practice Project:** Using Python's Scikit-learn library, build and train a basic sentiment analysis model on a dataset of customer reviews (e.g., from Kaggle). The model should be able to take a new review as input and classify it as \"positive\" or \"negative.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Skill Interdependencies**\n\n*   **Python (Phase 1)** is a direct prerequisite for the **Integration** API project in Phase 2 and is essential for the **Applied AI/ML** project in Phase 3.\n*   Understanding **Integration** concepts and APIs (Phase 2) is crucial before attempting the hands-on **SAP C4C** API project in Phase 3.\n*   The conceptual **AI/ML** foundation (Phase 2) provides the necessary context to successfully complete the **Applied AI/ML** project in Phase 3.\n\n### **Measurable Progress Metrics**\n\n1.  **Project Portfolio:** Complete 100% of the six mini-practice projects outlined in this roadmap, storing them in a personal Git repository to demonstrate practical application.\n2.  **Manager Skill Validation:** After completing Phase 2, schedule a session with your manager to demonstrate your Python project that uses Pandas, with the goal of formally updating your skill level from 1 to 2.\n3.  **API Proficiency:** Successfully complete 30 API-related challenges on a platform like Postman's \"30 Days of Postman for Developers\" by the end of Phase 3 to build practical integration skills.\n\nPhase 2: Recommendations Based on Your Mentor Session Takeaways\n\n- (MentorMatch Takeaway) Recommended course(s): BI104, Coursera: Python for Everybody, Internal: DS101, LeetCode practice sets",
