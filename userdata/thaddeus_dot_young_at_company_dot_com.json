  "chosen_upskillingplan": "## Supply Chain Intelligence Engineer Upskilling Roadmap\n\n**Weighted Gap Index:** 0.75\n\nThis roadmap prioritizes closing the most critical skill gaps to quickly improve your capabilities and then builds upon that foundation.  We assume 5-6 hours of learning per week.\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (Excel & SAP IBP foundational) \u2013 4 Weeks**\n\n**Goal:** Address the easiest missing skill (Excel) and significantly improve the underdeveloped skill (SAP IBP). This will provide immediate impact on your current role.\n\n| Skill          | Rationale                                           | Courses                                    | Mini Project                                      | Timeline (Weeks) |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Excel (Level 2)** |  Gain proficiency in essential data manipulation techniques for supply chain analysis. | SC104,  Online Excel tutorials (focus on pivot tables, VLOOKUP, macros) | Create a dashboard summarizing key supply chain metrics from a sample dataset. | 2                |\n| **SAP IBP (Level 4)** | Bridge the gap to meet the required proficiency in SAP IBP.  | SC101,  SAP IBP official training materials (focus on demand planning & supply planning modules) | Develop a simple demand plan within a simulated SAP IBP environment. | 2                |\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (Python Foundational) \u2013 8 Weeks**\n\n**Goal:** Acquire foundational Python programming skills crucial for supply chain analytics and automation.  This phase builds upon the Excel and SAP IBP improvements.\n\n| Skill          | Rationale                                           | Courses                                         | Mini Project                                       | Timeline (Weeks) | Interdependencies |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **Python (Level 3)** | Develop the programming skills to automate data analysis & build supply chain models. | Coursera: Python for Everybody, Internal: DS101  | Automate a data cleaning and preprocessing task using real or simulated supply chain data (e.g., cleaning and transforming a CSV file containing sales data).   | 8                 | Excel (data cleaning & transformation skills)         |\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Skills & Integration \u2013 8 Weeks**\n\n**Goal:**  Integrate learned skills to solve complex supply chain problems and develop advanced analytical capabilities.\n\n| Skill          | Rationale                                           | Courses/Resources                             | Mini Project                                      | Timeline (Weeks) | Interdependencies |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **Python (Level 3 Cont.) & IBP Integration** |  Combine Python with SAP IBP for advanced analytics and automation.  | LeetCode practice sets (focus on algorithm and data structure problems relevant to supply chain data),  Online resources on SAP IBP APIs and Python integration. | Develop a Python script that interacts with SAP IBP to automate reporting or data analysis. This might involve pulling data from SAP IBP and conducting advanced analysis. | 8                 | Python (Level 3), SAP IBP (Level 4)    |\n\n\n**Timeline Summary:**\n\n* **Phase 1:** 4 weeks\n* **Phase 2:** 8 weeks\n* **Phase 3:** 8 weeks\n* **Total:** 20 weeks (approximately 5 months)\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**  Excel skills are helpful for data preparation before using Python. Python skills are crucial for automating tasks and advanced analytics within the SAP IBP ecosystem (Phase 3).\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Excel Proficiency:** Achieve a score of 80% or higher on a standardized Excel skills assessment test.\n2. **SAP IBP Competency:** Successfully complete a simulated supply planning project within SAP IBP, meeting defined KPIs (e.g., inventory accuracy, service level).\n3. **Python Project Completion:** Successfully complete two mini-projects (one in Phase 2 and one in Phase 3), demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation, analysis and integration with other systems (e.g., SAP IBP).\n\n\nThis roadmap provides a structured approach.  Regular review and adjustments based on your progress are recommended. Remember to dedicate sufficient time for each phase to ensure effective learning and skill retention.\n",
