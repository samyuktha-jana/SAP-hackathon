This phase will build a foundation for future learning.\n\n* **(Manager priority) SQL & API Design Improvement:**  Enhance SQL querying and REST API design skills to directly improve integration quality.\n    * **Course:**  Codecademy's \"Learn SQL\" and  \"Learn APIs\" (or similar concise courses focusing on practical application).\n    * **Mini-project:** Design and implement a REST API to expose a simplified dataset from your existing database, focusing on efficient query design and robust error handling.  This directly addresses the manager's concerns about integration defects.\n\n* **(Manager priority) Integration Fundamentals:** Gain foundational knowledge of integration concepts and technologies relevant to your current work.\n    * **Course:**  A short, focused course on API integration using a relevant technology (e.g., MuleSoft Anypoint Platform Fundamentals if applicable to your environment, or a general REST API integration course).\n    * **Mini-project:** Integrate a small component of your existing system with a third-party API (e.g., a weather API for a customer-facing application).  This allows for hands-on experience tackling the highlighted integration issues.\n\n* **(MentorMatch Takeaway) Python Introduction:** Begin learning Python syntax and fundamental data structures to prepare for more advanced applications later.\n    * **Course:**  Coursera's \"Python for Everybody\" Specialization (select relevant modules for a 4-week timeframe).\n    * **Mini-project:** Create a simple Python script to automate a repetitive task related to your current work, e.g., data cleaning or report generation.  This bridges the gap between immediate needs and the long-term goal of leveraging Python in AI/ML.\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Focus:** Develop core competencies in Python programming and integration techniques, laying the groundwork for advanced applications with SAP C4C.\n\n* **Python for Data Analysis:** Learn to utilize Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.\n    * **Course:**  DataCamp's \"Intermediate Python for Data Science\" or similar.\n    * **Mini-project:** Develop a Python script to analyze a dataset relevant to your work and create visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn.\n\n* **Integration Patterns and Technologies:**  Explore various integration patterns (e.g., message queues, ETL processes) and technologies beyond REST APIs.\n    * **Course:**  Udacity's \"Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree\" (relevant modules on Microservices and APIs) or equivalent.\n    * **Mini-project:**  Design and implement a more complex integration using a message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka), focusing on asynchronous communication and data handling.\n\n* **Database Interactions with Python:**  Learn to interact with databases (e.g., SQL databases) using Python.\n    * **Course:**  Combine elements from a database course (e.g., a specific SQL database tutorial) with your Python learning.\n    * **Mini-project:** Create a Python script that interacts with your organization's database to extract, transform, and load data.\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Applications (12 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Focus:** Integrate learned skills with SAP C4C and explore advanced AI/ML applications within the CX context.\n\n* **SAP C4C Fundamentals:** Gain a working knowledge of SAP C4C's functionalities and architecture.\n    * **Course:** SAP Learning Hub's \"SAP Customer Engagement Center (C4C)\" courses (select relevant modules based on your role).  Look for specific training related to the APIs and integration points.\n    * **Mini-project:** Develop a simple integration between a custom application and SAP C4C using the available APIs.\n\n* **Advanced Python for AI/ML:**  Apply your Python skills to build and deploy AI/ML models for CX applications.\n    * **Course:**  Fast.ai's practical deep learning courses or similar (consider focusing on specific AI/ML techniques relevant to CX, e.g., sentiment analysis, recommendation systems).\n    * **Mini-project:** Develop a simple AI/ML model (e.g., a sentiment analysis model for customer feedback) and integrate it with SAP C4C or another CX system.\n\n\n**Interdependencies:** Phase 1 builds a foundation in Python and integration, crucial for Phases 2 and 3. Phase 2's core skills in Python and integration are prerequisites for the advanced applications in Phase 3, which heavily leverages SAP C4C.\n\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Successful Integration Deployments:** Track the number of successful integration deployments with zero defects.\n2. **Python Script Execution Efficiency:** Measure the runtime and resource consumption of developed Python scripts, aiming for improvement over time.\n3. **SAP C4C API Integration Success Rate:**  Track the success rate of API calls and integrations within SAP C4C.\n\n\n**Timeline:**  Total estimated time: 24 weeks (flexible based on individual learning pace and available time).  The suggested time per phase is a guideline; adjust as needed.\n\nPhase 2: Recommendations Based on Your Mentor Session Takeaways\n\n- (MentorMatch Takeaway) Recommended course(s): BI104, Coursera: Python for Everybody, Internal: DS101, LeetCode practice sets",
