It focuses on quick wins to build momentum and confidence.\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Address the most impactful missing skill and improve the underdeveloped skill to a functional level.\n\n| Skill           | Rationale                                                              | Courses                                     | Mini Project                                          | Interdependencies |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Python (Level 2)** | Foundational for AI/ML and integration; rapid learning curve.           | CX104, Coursera: Python for Everybody           | Build a simple script to automate a repetitive task.     | None               |\n| **SAP C4C (Level 3)** | Improve existing knowledge to meet the required proficiency level.      | CX101, Internal training resources if available | Create a small report/dashboard using SAP C4C data. | None               |\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Master crucial AI/ML and integration skills.\n\n| Skill           | Rationale                                                              | Courses                                         | Mini Project                                                   | Interdependencies |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **AI/ML (Level 3)** | Essential for developing and implementing AI solutions in CX.            | CX102, relevant online courses (e.g., fast.ai) | Build a simple predictive model using a relevant CX dataset.     | Python             |\n| **Integration (Level 3)** | Crucial for connecting AI models with existing CX systems.             | CX103, relevant API documentation                  | Integrate a simple AI model with a dummy CX system (e.g., using REST APIs). | Python, AI/ML     |\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Application (6 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Goal:** Integrate and apply learned skills to build a more complex, real-world project.\n\n| Skill           | Rationale                                                              | Courses/Resources                             | Mini Project                                                            | Interdependencies |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Advanced AI/ML & Integration** |  Apply advanced techniques and build a sophisticated solution. | Kaggle competitions, advanced online courses   | Develop a more complex AI-powered CX solution (e.g., chatbot integration, sentiment analysis). | All previous skills |\n\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* **Phase 1:** 4 weeks\n* **Phase 2:** 8 weeks\n* **Phase 3:** 6 weeks\n\n**Total estimated time:** 18 weeks (assuming 5-6 hours/week)\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**  Python is a prerequisite for AI/ML and Integration.  AI/ML and Integration are prerequisites for Phase 3.\n\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Completion of courses and mini-projects:** Track completion rates and assess the quality of work.\n2. **Successful integration of AI models:** Measure the accuracy and efficiency of AI model integrations in mini-projects.\n3. **Portfolio development:** Build a portfolio showcasing completed projects and demonstrating proficiency in relevant skills.  This portfolio should serve as a concrete measure of acquired skills.\n\n\n**Note:** This roadmap is a suggestion and can be adjusted based on individual learning pace and resource availability.  Regular self-assessment and feedback are essential for effective upskilling.  Consider leveraging mentorship opportunities to accelerate your learning and receive expert guidance.\n",
