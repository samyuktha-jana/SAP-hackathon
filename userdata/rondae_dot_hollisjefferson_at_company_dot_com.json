It incorporates manager feedback and acknowledges interdependencies between skills.\n\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**(Manager priority) SQL Polishing:**  Improving SQL skills is crucial for data manipulation within AI/ML projects and general data analysis.\n\n* **Rationale:**  Strengthening fundamental SQL skills will immediately improve efficiency and accuracy in current tasks.\n* **Courses:**  DataCamp: SQL Fundamentals, Codecademy: Learn SQL.\n* **Mini-project:**  Develop SQL queries to analyze a sample dataset relevant to your current projects (e.g., customer interaction data, sales figures), focusing on joins, aggregations, and subqueries.\n\n\n**Phase 1:  Python Fundamentals:** Python is a foundational language for AI/ML and integrations.\n\n* **Rationale:** Building a solid Python foundation enables faster learning of more advanced AI/ML concepts and integrations.\n* **Courses:**  CX104 (if suitable for this need level), Coursera: Python for Everybody.\n* **Mini-project:**  Create a simple Python script to automate a repetitive task related to your current work (e.g., data extraction, report generation).\n\n\n**Timeline:** 4 weeks\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (8 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**Integration:**  Integration skills are vital for connecting various systems within the CX ecosystem.\n\n* **Rationale:**  Mastering integration techniques allows seamless data flow and functionality across applications.\n* **Courses:** CX103, Udemy: API Integration with Python (choose a course relevant to your integration needs).\n* **Mini-project:**  Develop a simple integration between two systems (e.g., using APIs to connect a database to a reporting tool)\n\n\n**AI/ML Fundamentals:** A foundational understanding of AI/ML is essential for this role.\n\n* **Rationale:**  This lays the groundwork for applying AI/ML to solve CX problems.\n* **Courses:** CX102, fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders.\n* **Mini-project:**  Develop a simple machine learning model (e.g., regression or classification) to analyze a dataset relevant to your work.  This could leverage your SQL and Python skills developed in Phase 1.\n\n\n**Timeline:** 8 weeks (dependent on Phase 1 completion)\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Skills (8 weeks, 5-6 hrs/week)**\n\n**SAP C4C Expertise:**  Proficiency in SAP C4C is critical for interacting with the core CX system.\n\n* **Rationale:**  Deep understanding of SAP C4C enables efficient use of the platform and contributes to effective solutions.\n* **Courses:** CX101, official SAP C4C training (if available).\n* **Mini-project:**  Develop a customized report or application within SAP C4C to address a specific business need, utilizing your acquired integration and AI/ML skills.  This will solidify your core skills and demonstrate their practical application.\n\n\n**Advanced AI/ML Techniques:** This phase allows specialized skill development.\n\n* **Rationale:**  Exploring more advanced techniques allows for the development of more sophisticated solutions.\n* **Courses:**  Select courses focusing on specific AI/ML areas relevant to your role (e.g., NLP, computer vision, time series analysis). Consider specialization certifications.\n* **Mini-project:**  Develop a more complex AI/ML model addressing a challenging business problem, utilizing gained knowledge in the chosen specialization.\n\n\n**Timeline:** 8 weeks (dependent on Phase 2 completion)\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**\n\n* Phase 1 Python is essential for Phase 2 Integration and AI/ML.\n* Phase 2 Integration and AI/ML skills are critical for Phase 3 SAP C4C project.\n* SQL skills (Phase 1) are beneficial throughout all phases.\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Completion of courses and mini-projects:** Track the completion status of each learning activity.\n2. **Improved performance on SQL queries:** Measure the efficiency and accuracy of SQL queries before and after Phase 1.\n3. **Successful implementation of mini-projects:** Evaluate the functionality and effectiveness of completed projects.  This should directly translate to demonstrable improvements in your work tasks.\n\n\nThis roadmap provides a structured approach to upskilling. Remember to adapt the timeline and courses based on your learning pace and specific needs. Regular feedback sessions with your manager will be crucial to monitor progress and adjust the plan as needed.\n",
