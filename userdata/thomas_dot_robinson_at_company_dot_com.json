It focuses on quick wins to build momentum and confidence, followed by core skills and finally advanced specialization.  A 5-6 hour weekly commitment is assumed.\n\n\n**Phase 1: Quick Wins (4 weeks)**\n\n**Goal:**  Establish foundational Python skills and gain familiarity with a key integration concept. This builds confidence and prepares you for more complex learning.\n\n| Skill             | Rationale                                                                   | Courses                                     | Mini Project                                      | Interdependencies |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Python (Improve)    | Strengthening Python will enable faster learning of AI/ML and integrations.     | CX104 (if suitable), Coursera: Python for Everybody | Build a simple Python script to process CSV data.  | None               |\n\n\n**Phase 2: Core Skills (12 weeks)**\n\n**Goal:**  Acquire the core skills essential for the role:  Understanding SAP C4C, basic AI/ML concepts and integration techniques.\n\n| Skill             | Rationale                                                                | Courses                                     | Mini Project                                                | Interdependencies |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| SAP C4C           | Mastering SAP C4C is fundamental for a CX AI Solutions Engineer.         | CX101                                         | Develop a simple custom report or extension within SAP C4C.  | None               |\n| AI/ML (foundational)| Basic understanding of AI/ML is crucial for applying it within CX solutions.| CX102                                         | Build a simple predictive model (e.g., customer churn prediction) using a readily available dataset and Python. | Python             |\n| Integration (foundational)| Foundational knowledge in integration is key to connecting systems and data. | CX103                                         | Create a simple data integration flow between two mock systems (e.g., using Python and APIs).  | Python             |\n\n\n**Phase 3: Advanced Specialization (8 weeks)**\n\n**Goal:**  Develop advanced proficiency in chosen areas and apply skills to real-world scenarios.\n\n| Skill             | Rationale                                                                             | Courses                                  | Mini Project                                                                     | Interdependencies |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| AI/ML (advanced)    | Advanced knowledge of AI/ML allows you to build and deploy more sophisticated models. | Advanced AI/ML course (e.g., specialized Coursera/edX) | Develop a more complex AI/ML model for a realistic CX challenge (e.g., chatbot enhancement). | AI/ML (foundational), Python, SAP C4C |\n| Integration (advanced)| Advanced integration techniques enable seamless data flow and system interaction.      | Advanced Integration course (API specialization) | Develop a robust integration solution between SAP C4C and another system (e.g., CRM).    | Integration (foundational), SAP C4C      |\n\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* Phase 1: 4 weeks\n* Phase 2: 12 weeks\n* Phase 3: 8 weeks\n* **Total: 24 weeks (approximately 6 months)**\n\n\n**Interdependencies:**  Python proficiency is crucial for Phases 2 and 3.  A foundational understanding of AI/ML and integration is needed for advanced specialization.  SAP C4C knowledge is essential for integrating AI/ML solutions within the CX platform.\n\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Completion of courses and mini-projects:** Track the completion status of each course and project within the roadmap.\n2. **Successful integration of AI/ML models in SAP C4C:**  Demonstrate the ability to integrate and deploy functional AI/ML models within the SAP C4C environment.\n3. **Development of a portfolio of integration solutions:**  Build a portfolio showcasing successful integration projects connecting different systems.\n\n\n**Note:**  This roadmap is a suggestion and can be adjusted based on your learning pace and specific job requirements.  Consider incorporating regular reviews and seeking feedback to ensure you stay on track.  Internal resources (like DS101 and LeetCode) should be prioritized where applicable, as they might offer faster and more targeted learning pathways.\n",
