Strong Python skills are crucial for implementing AI/ML models effectively within SAP C4C.\n\n\n**Timeline:**  Total estimated timeline: 18 weeks (assuming 5-6 hours/week).  Adjust based on individual learning pace.\n\n\n**Measurable Progress Metrics:**\n\n1. **Completion of designated courses and certifications:** Track successful completion of each course with a certificate or equivalent.\n2. **Successful completion of mini-projects:**  Document and showcase completed projects in a portfolio. Include code, documentation and results.\n3. **Completion of a capstone project (Phase 3):** A fully functional integration of AI/ML with SAP C4C, demonstrating practical application of acquired skills.\n\n\n**Note:** This roadmap is a suggestion and can be adapted based on individual learning styles, prior experience, and resource availability.  Regular review and adjustments are recommended to ensure continuous progress.  Consider seeking mentorship or guidance throughout the learning process.\n",
